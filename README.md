# RockwellLifeCycle
This is a script to pull the lifecycle status data off of Rockwell Automation's website. 

First of all, bear in mind that I'm not a Python developer, I was looking to solve a problem and not to make something functional and easy to use for everyone. 

There's a file named Book2 with the part numbers in the first column. Update this file with the parts that you need lifecycle information for. 

Update the path to the Book2.xslx file and also the results file at the top of the script. 

Make sure you have the required packages (requests, openpyxl and json).
